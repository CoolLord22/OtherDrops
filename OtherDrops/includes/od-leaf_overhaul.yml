#### Tree leaves drop apples & sticks (birch leaves drop cocoa beans) - very low chance of golden apple

# Note: an average normal tree may have around 50 leaves
# This means a 0.5% chance = 1 apple per 4 trees on average
# Consider how many trees players chop down when changing this chance

# Note2: for special "Apple Trees" see the AppleSeed plugin
# (I combine this rare standard drop with apple trees from that)
