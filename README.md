Building from source
--------------------

These instructions assume you have already forked and/or cloned the project and have on your computer.

Change the plugin.yml (as generated by plugin.yml.template) to fix the version, potentially by adding your name with a dash (3.1.3-Name)

OtherDrops comes with most dependencies already stored in the repository (for simplicity) however
you need to download a Bukkit build and place into the `lib` folder - rename it to `bukkit.jar`

Then build using your IDE or:

    $ ant jar

Use `ant -p` to see a complete list of Ant tasks.
